# HC11-Alarm-Clock
Using a HC11 micro-controller I made a digital alarm clock with a display time and an Alarm Clock.
This Program will simulate a simple clock with Hours(12) & Minutes(60) on 4 7-Segment Displays.
* Using pin PE7 to adjust time and alarm time.
* The user can change the alarm time by pressing PA0. If the user presses PA0 again The program will allow them to change the time.
* Each digit can be changed by using the Potentiometer. Once the desired digit is displayed press to advance to next digit.
* PM is the dot on the leftmost 7-Segment Display. Once PM/AM is selected the program will return you to regular clock.
* When the alarm time and clock time are equal the buzzer will activate. Press PA0 to turn alarm off. (Note changing time and..
* the alarm will not be active) Alarm automaticly turns off after 30 seconds.
