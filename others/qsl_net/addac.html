<HR>
The converter was designed as a template for a professional design on Marvin Green's BOTBoard.<BR>
The Maxim 512 chip makes the wiring and programming easy, although there were some 'confusing&nbsp;§_!#!**' around the SPCR and SPSR in the Motorola Handbooks.<BR>
Port C drives 8 LED's just as a trace, to see if the program is running.<BR>
The speed for this application will be around 8 kHz, I did not try to optimize it, because the final application will need only very slow A-outputs. If you think it must be faster, you could start the converter after fetching the A/D data from the previous conversion. If the program becomes too big, the SPI-transmitter could be realized in realtime ...<BR>
